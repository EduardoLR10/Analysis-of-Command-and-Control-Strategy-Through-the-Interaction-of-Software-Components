abstract = {Java has no module system. Its packages only subdivide the class name space, allowing only a very limited form of component-level information hiding and reuse. Two Java Community Processes have started addressing this problem: one describes the runtime system and has reached an early draft stage, while the other considers the developer's view and only has a straw-man proposal. Both are natural language documents, which inevitably contain ambiguities.In this work we design and formalize a core module system for Java. Where the JCP documents are complete, we follow them closely; elsewhere we make reasonable choices. We define the syntax, the type system, and the operational semantics of an LJAM language, defining these rigorously in the Isabelle/HOL automated proof assistant. Using this formalization, we identify various issues with the module system. We highlight the underlying design decisions, and discuss several alternatives and their benefits. Our Isabelle/HOL definitions should provide a basis for further consideration of the design alternatives, for reference implementations, and for proofs of soundness.},

	We present PARAM 1.0, a model checker for parametric discrete-time
	Markov chains (PMCs). PARAM can evaluate temporal properties of
	PMCs and certain extensions of this class. Due to parametricity,
	evaluation results are polynomials or rational functions. By
	instantiating the parameters in the result function, one can cheaply
	obtain results for multiple individual instantiations, based on only
	a single more expensive analysis. In addition, it is possible to
	post-process the result function symbolically using for instance
	computer algebra packages, to derive optimum parameters or to
	identify worst cases.}
